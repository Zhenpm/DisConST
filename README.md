## set up

First clone the repository. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Zhenpm/DisConST.git 
cd DisConST-main
```
Then, we suggest creating a new environmentï¼š <br />

conda activate disconst
```
Additionally, install the packages required: <br />
```
pip install -r requiements.txt
``` 

## Datasets
In this work, we employed five ST datasets to DisConST, including 12 slices of Human Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC), 2 slices of mouse olfactory bul tissue from Stereo-seq and ST sequencing technology, 2 sections of mouse brain sagittal slices, a human breast cancer slice and  9 slices of Mouse Organogenesis Spatiotemporal Transcriptomic Atlas (MOSTA) from Streo-seq and seqFiSH sequencing technology. <br />
